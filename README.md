## Learnings 
- The fundamentals of modern and semantic HTML, CSS, and building layouts in a small separate project, which will prepare you for the main course project (www.omnifood.dev). This includes modern flexbox and CSS Grid!

- How to design beautiful websites, by learning a web design framework I created just for this course. It consists of easy-to-use guidelines for design aspects like typography, colors, images, spacing, and more (this is like a small standalone course!).

- How to use well-established website components and layout patterns in order to come up with professional-looking designs

- How to make any website work on any mobile device, no matter the design and layout (responsive design)

- How to use the 7 steps of building a professional website in practice: planning, sketching, designing, building, testing, optimizing, and launching

- How to find and use free design assets such as images, fonts, and icons

- Important developer skills such as reading documentation, fixing code errors on your own, and using professional web development tools
